1. Population Dynamics:
   - What should be the initial population size?
   - What is the target equilibrium frequency for the SSA phenotype?
   - Should we implement population growth/decline or maintain constant size?

2. Genetic Architecture:
   - How many loci should influence the SSA phenotype?
   - What should be the mutation rate per locus?
   - Should we implement epistasis between loci?

3. Selection Pressures:
   - What is the direct fitness cost for males with SSA phenotype?
   - How should inclusive fitness benefits be calculated?
   - Should we implement frequency-dependent selection?

4. Cultural Factors:
   - How many cultural dimensions should we track?
   - What is the rate of cultural transmission?
   - How do cultural factors interact with genetic predisposition?

5. Spatial Structure:
   - What should be the migration rate between subpopulations?
   - How should local mate choice be implemented?
   - What is the appropriate spatial scale for interactions?

6. Validation:
   - What are the target statistics for validation?
   - How many generations should the simulation run?
   - What statistical tests should be used to validate results?
